# Good software practice (GSP)
	1.DRY : 
             We used helper short methods that do a specific things that most of methods need. For example, ___ in class bla bla 
	2.Well-named, commented and short methods : 
             For instance, the ___ methods 
             in the MainPage class have clear names that indicate their purpose, and they are commented to provide additional context. 
             Keeping methods short and focused on a specific task enhances readability, understandability, and maintainability of the codebase.
